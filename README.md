# GenAI-Tutorial

Welcome to the GenAI LLM Tutorial! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use OpenAI's Generative Artificial Intelligence Language Model (GenAI LLM) to generate text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- OpenAI Python Library (`openai`)

You can install the OpenAI Python library via pip:

```bash
pip install openai
```

### OpenAI API Key

To use the GenAI LLM, you'll need an OpenAI API key. If you don't have one, you can sign up for the API access [here](https://platform.openai.com/signup).

Once you have your API key, set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/genai-llm-tutorial.git
cd genai-llm-tutorial
```

## Usage

### Running the Example Script

In the repository, you'll find an example Python script `generate_text.py`. This script demonstrates how to generate text using GenAI LLM.

Run the script:

```bash
python generate_text.py
```

### Customizing Generation

You can customize the text generation by modifying the parameters in the script. The `prompt` variable defines the starting text for the model to continue. Experiment with different prompts to see how the model responds.
